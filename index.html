Dr. Jerald F. Dirks and Debra L. Dirks journeyed into Islam through many avenues and byways, saying Shahadah in 1993.  Al-Hamdulillah!  Their journey went through the Arabian horse and its history, Christian theology, and ancient and modern history, and it continues to be an ongoing process still today.  They consider themselves to be students of Islam and are always learning and sharing.  Currently, Dr. and Mrs. Dirks are writing books, conducting workshops, and giving speeches around the globe.

This website is an answer to the many who have requested a way to contact them.  The website is divided into sections covering biographical information, information on the books they have authored and how to order them, and information on how to schedule lectures, workshops, manuscript editing, and consultations regarding private Islamic schools, Islamic public relations efforts, and Da'wah.

While this website's email is checked daily when they are at home, it is not checked while they are traveling in connection with the above events.  Please extend to them your patience in this matter.  They are looking forward to hearing from you.  Please do contact them, suggest ways this website could be more useful to you, and let them know how they may help you, Insha'Allah.  Thank you.
