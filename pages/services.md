Scheduling Lectures and Workshops:

To  arrange for lectures and/or workshops by Dr. and/or Mrs. Dirks, email them at dirksjf_dls@yahoo.com.  The following issues pertain to scheduling lectures and workshops.

1.  Air fare from and to Wichita, KS, transportation to and from the airport in the host city, inexpensive hotel/motel accommodations in the host city, meals in the host city, and $50 in expense money should be provided.  These should all be arranged for and paid by the organization that is hosting us, with the $50 in expense money being added to our honorarium.  If we are to secure our own meals in the host city, an additional $10 per meal per person should be added to our expense money.

2.  Honoraria fees are as follows:  (A) a single lecture of up to one hour in length = $1000; (B) all-day seminar = $1,500; (C) multiple lectures (not to exceed one hour each) across adjacent days or on the same day = $1000 for the first lecture and $600 for each additional lecture; (D) Q & A sessions (up to 45 minutes in length) following A, B, or C = no charge.  If your request does not fit into A-C, prior arrangements need to be made with us regarding the honorarium.  (In considering these fees, please bear in mind that we spend a considerable amount of time in preparation and travel.)

3.  If an all-day seminar is being arranged, we will bring a CD with a Power Point presentation.  However, it will be up to the host organization to have a laptop computer and projector ready to use the Power Point presentation.

4.  With rare exception, all scheduling should be finalized 30 days in advance of the scheduled lecture or workshop.  Please do not add additional lectures at the last minute, as we will not have time to prepare for them.
